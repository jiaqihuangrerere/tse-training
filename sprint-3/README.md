## sprint 3
This sprint is focused on introducing templating and MongoDB. As with the last sprint, keep updating your progress on the repo's Kanban Boards as you go along.

### Templating
Now that you have a decent grasp of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, it's time to move on to templates. Templates are kind of the same, but not really; they're exactly what the name implies: document templates that don't contain any data. They're essentially generic documents that we can pass data into on-the-fly, allowing us to reuse the same web documents over and over again with different data&mdash;super useful. [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is the templating engine we'll be using.
1. Read [this beginner's guide to Handlebars](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-handlebars/) up to the bit about custom helpers. *Note: the guide mentions a JavaScript file that needs to be loaded, but the templating engine is already baked into our Express app.*

### Project 4: discount-twitter-1
__Description__: *use templating from a .json file to automatically generate site code and add "chirps" from the site.*
1. Recreate the screenshot below (no need to copy over all the "chirps"&mdash;just one will do):
![final](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/tse-training/blob/master/sprint-3/reference/final.png "final")

*Note: to get the icons, check out [the font-awesome icon set](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&m=free). The exact ones used are `comment`, `retweet`, and `heart`. The font-awesome stylesheet is included in the starter code.*

For getting started on the page layout, see this wireframe:
![wireframe](https://github.com/sumeet-bansal/tse-training/blob/master/sprint-3/reference/wireframe.png "wireframe")

This wireframe doesn't specify what the final page should look like so much as how the page should be laid out. The text accompanying the page sections (top-left of each rectangle) refer to the Bootstrap class you'll need to use for that section.

2. Templatize that wireframe. Basically, take all the hardcoded text in the chirp you structured by hand and add the corresponding Handlebars expressions from `chirps.json` (e.g. `KANYE WEST (@kanyewest)` becomes `{{author_name}} (@{{author_handle}})`).
3. Create a route `\new` that allows you to add a chirp to your list in `chirps.json` by specifying all the fields.

### MongoDB
1. Install MongoDB by following [this guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/).
2. Follow to completion [this blog post](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/) from the last sprint.

### Project 4.5: discount-twitter-2
__Description__: *migrate discount-twitter to MongoDB.*
1. Set up the MongoDB database and collection.
2. Migrate discount-twitter-1 to use MongoDB instead of just a `.json` file.

__Since other people are going to be on this repo as well, please don't merge anything back into `master`&mdash;just work on your own branch.__
